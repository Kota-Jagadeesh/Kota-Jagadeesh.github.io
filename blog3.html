            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1454165804606-c3d57bc86b40?w=800&h=400&fit=crop" alt="Open Source Exploration" class="blog-image">
            <p>Ever wondered what open source is? When I first joined Amrita University, I stumbled upon amFOSS during induction. It was my first encounter with this exciting world! Back in Andhra Pradesh, I studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, and Sanskrit—but zero computer science. 🤔</p>
            <p><strong>Question for you:</strong> Could you imagine diving into coding with no prior skills? I did! Despite using Windows and lacking programming knowledge, amFOSS seemed like the perfect launchpad to learn CS. Are you ready to take the plunge? 😄</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Tackling Praveshan: My First Challenge! ⏳💡</h2>
            <p>Curious about joining amFOSS? The gateway was Praveshan, their recruitment event. I got the task list and knew what to do—but lacked the skills! Each task took 7-10 days as a coding newbie. 😅</p>
            <p><strong>Challenge for you:</strong> Can you guess how I overcame not knowing tools? I watched tutorials, read documentation, and burned the midnight oil until 1-2 a.m.! By submission, I finished 6 of 10 tasks. First-years got a boost, so I reached the interview—thrilled yet nervous! 🎯</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Interview Setback: A Learning Curve! 😞📚</h2>
            <p>Have you ever faced interview jitters? My online interview was a disaster—I froze, missed the first question, and forgot answers due to nerves. Result? Not selected. But wait—did that stop me? No! I turned it into a learning opportunity. 🌱</p>
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Did you know tension can blank your mind? I spent three months mastering open source, Linux, Git, GitHub, and coding in my hostel—gaining confidence by semester’s end! 💪</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Praveshan S2: My Redemption Arc! ✨🏆</h2>
            <p>Ever had a second chance? At 11:50 p.m., scrolling reels at home, I saw Praveshan S2 announced—my shot at redemption! I joined Discord, applied, and tackled tasks with newfound skills, finishing faster and accurately. 🎉</p>
            <p><strong>Quiz Time:</strong> What kept me calm this time? Experience! The interview went well, and I got the email—I’m in amFOSS! My CS journey began, and I’m now exploring mobile and web development. 🚀</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why Explore Open Source? A Must for CS Students! 🌍🎓</h2>
            <p>Interested in real-world coding? Open source, via amFOSS projects, builds Git and teamwork skills—key for jobs! With tasks, mentorship, and Praveshan, amFOSS guides beginners to confidence and problem-solving. 🌟</p>
            <p><strong>Your Turn:</strong> Ready to join a supportive community and apply classroom knowledge? It’s your gateway to a tech career! 🤓</p>
